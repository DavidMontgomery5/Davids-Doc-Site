Today I finished my Internship journal and had a meeting with Curtis and Cameron about the background of the IDS department and how its gotten to where it is now. Which gave me a lot of insight because if I want to make changes to the Intranet. I have to to understand where its came from. I also showed them some of my visions for the future and an improved layout to the Reporting Development Site.
