Learned the right way to set up a website from scratch. Talked with Stefanie today also because she can now edit the Human Resources Page on the Intranet. Taj overall is helping me become a better programmer and web developer. Met some new people on the 3rd floor which was pretty cool.

Got introduced to the Surge Summer Internship Budyu Program today. My Cross department buddy is Matt Gallant which I already met yesterday, Hes really cool. My Intradepartmental Buddy is Taj, who we already know. Very Fun Day.

## 6/3/22 - \_

Had a touch base meeting today with the IDS department and talked about how my projects are going. I also had a meeting with my fellow interns today to discuss the oppurtunity of volunteering for a notable 501(3c) charity, which was really fun because i've never volunteered anywhere before. Were looking at Habitates for Humanities and the Food Bank. Then after that I had a meeting with Cameron and Curtis to talk about how our expierence as interns are going and to make sure that we are doing okay in our journey. Then me and my interns gathered in Meerkat to work on projects and just talk to each other.
