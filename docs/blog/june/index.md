## Week of May 31st - June 6th: Training Wheels Are Off

- Met Les who told us about his background all over the world which was very insightful. Learned the right way to set up a website from scratch.
- Talked with Stefanie on June 1st, because she can now edit the Human Resources Page on the Intranet. Taj overall is helping me become a better programmer and web developer. Met some new people on the 3rd floor which was pretty cool.
- Got introduced to the Surge Summer Internship Buddy Program on June 2nd. My Cross department buddy is Matt Gallant which I already met yesterday, Hes really cool. My Intradepartmental Buddy is Taj, who we already know. Very Fun Day.
- Had a touch base meeting on June 3rd with the IDS department and talked about how my projects are going.
- I also had a meeting with my fellow interns today to discuss the oppurtunity of volunteering for a notable 501(3c) charity, which was really fun because i've never volunteered anywhere before. Were looking at Habitates for Humanities and the Food Bank. Then after that I had a meeting with Cameron and Curtis to talk about how our expierence as interns are going and to make sure that we are doing okay in our journey. Then me and my fellow interns gathered in Meerkat to work on projects and just get to know eachother.

## Week of June 6th - June 10:

- June 6th was a pretty quite day at the office Taj taught me more about Github. Going into more detail he taught me about forking while also teaching me about push and pull requests. I also learned that sometimes entire companies are run through github, which was a pretty fascinating thought. Another cool thing about github was that people who follow you can take a copy of your work and improve it by themselves then submit it back to you for approval, Thats kinda awesome.
- June 7th started off with an IDS meeting witch was informitive. Then later on in the day me and Taj met with Ivan about a project on Alteryx which showed me that its good to be a jack of all trades. Then the day ended with a meeting with Nisha from Human Resources. It showed the background of Surges HR team and what they do. Very gratful for that meeting.
- On June 8th, Taj set up a meeting with us about his previous internship expierence, where he went over his final presentation which gave me a lot of ideas and insperation for how I wanna do my final presentation.
- June 9th started off with another IDS team meeting then we had a meeting about the field trip were doing that takes us out to the operation site in Moss Creek which was very fun. Im really excited to go on that trip. Then after that we had a lunch with Curtis Smith where we learned about his background and rise to where he is today. The stories he told us were really nice and it came to my attention that the way his early career started is kind of how I want to model mine. I figured out that I really want to travel at one point in my career.
- On June 10th, the interns met to discuss the final touches on a Volunteer project were working on. Then Me and Cameron had lunch with Curtis to discuss how our internship process is going and just discussing our expierences at the company. Very good Week :)

## Week of June 13th - June 17th

- June 13th was a day full of learning how data travels after information leaves the local network and enters the internet. Coming to understand all componets of a URL and getting familier with Internet Exchange Points, gateway nodes, and IP addresses.
- Then on June 14th, Taj helped me set up my first live site on the internet. I did this by taking my github and connecting it to my netlify while also making sure its secure and safe by using cloudflare to protect it from unwanted visitors. I also purchased my first domain name that I will connect to my portfolio site when it is up and running. June 14th was more about understanding how to connect everything together which is very important in terms taking care of a live website. We also had a Surge Summer Fun Luncheon today which was nice, I got the chance to show my co-workers a volunteer project that me and my fellow interns are working on for the company to raise awareness for the HR departments Volunteered Time Off.
