## Week of May 31st - June 6th: Training Wheels Are Off

Learned the right way to set up a website from scratch. Talked with Stefanie on June 1st, because she can now edit the Human Resources Page on the Intranet. Taj overall is helping me become a better programmer and web developer. Met some new people on the 3rd floor which was pretty cool. Got introduced to the Surge Summer Internship Buddy Program on June 2nd. My Cross department buddy is Matt Gallant which I already met yesterday, Hes really cool. My Intradepartmental Buddy is Taj, who we already know. Very Fun Day. Had a touch base meeting on June 3rd with the IDS department and talked about how my projects are going. I also had a meeting with my fellow interns today to discuss the oppurtunity of volunteering for a notable 501(3c) charity, which was really fun because i've never volunteered anywhere before. Were looking at Habitates for Humanities and the Food Bank. Then after that I had a meeting with Cameron and Curtis to talk about how our expierence as interns are going and to make sure that we are doing okay in our journey. Then me and my interns gathered in Meerkat to work on projects and just get to know eachother.
