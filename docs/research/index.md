## [Sharepoint](/research/sharepoint/)

Organizations use SharePoint to securely organize and distribute valuble information. Surge Energys transition to SharePoint was met with some inconveniences due to the pandemic. Thats why I feel its important that I do my reasearch on Sharepoint so that I can aid them in materializing their dreams. Find my SharePoint research here at [SharePoint](/research/sharepoint/)

## [Web Development](/research/webdev/)

Working with Websites from the ground up is relatively new to me. Whether it be working in Visual Studio Code or editing the layout of the website through an Intranet editor. I have a lot a room for improvement. So click here for my research on [Web Development](/research/webdev/)

## [Github](/research/github/)

When it comes to using Github in a work enviorment, documentation and collaboration as a programer is insanely important. I've had a Github account for a while now and I feel like with me working at Surge Energy i'm using it more. So I feel like it's important that I learn how to navigate Github independently.
